# Agent Working Agreements

## Scope

- Keep changes small and tied to the current request.
- Ask before expanding into unrelated modules.
- If a task requires files outside the agreed working area, say so first.

## User Changes

- Do not revert user changes unless explicitly requested.
- Treat dirty worktrees as normal.
- If user changes affect the task, work with them.

## Git

- Default: the agent edits and verifies; the user reviews and commits.
- Branch naming: `TODO`.
- Generated files policy: `TODO`.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, local databases, logs, or caches.
- Follow `tools/project-memory/git-preferences.json` for commit-message
  languages. English is primary; selected additional languages are included when
  the user explicitly asks the agent to commit.
- To change commit-message languages, run:

```powershell
.\tools\select-git-commit-languages.ps1
```

or:

```powershell
.\tools\agent-start.ps1 -ConfigureGitCommitLanguages
```

## Context Hygiene

- Do not print full `git diff` output by default. Prefer `git diff --stat` and
  targeted queries for relevant files or patterns.
- Do not read large files in full by default, including large `index.html`,
  bundled JS/CSS, logs, lockfiles, generated files, and build artifacts. Prefer
  targeted searches, heads, tails, or small line ranges such as
  `Get-Content -TotalCount`, `Get-Content -Tail`, and `Select-String` on
  PowerShell.
- For verification, count or query HTML elements programmatically instead of
  printing the whole HTML document.
- Do not produce broad artifacts, such as zip archives, or run full check
  matrices unless the user explicitly asks for that scope.
- Final responses should summarize only the changes, checks, and current status;
  do not restate the full investigation context.
- Search for specific symbols, paths, errors, or patterns before doing broad
  repository scans.
- Do not print large logs. Prefer tails and targeted error searches.
- Launch applications in the background so focus does not jump away from the
  user's current window.
- Treat a short first message as a possible chat title: restore context, then
  ask what to do next instead of executing the title as a task.
- Treat a first message that points to a shared instruction library as an
  instruction bootstrap, not as a request to add that library as a dependency.
- If the user asks to update from a shared instruction library and this project
  has no `tools/project-memory/instruction-kit.json`, treat that as first-time
  instruction bootstrap/init.
- For web applications, assume the user will inspect the UI manually. Do not
  open, browse, screenshot, or visually inspect the UI automatically unless the
  user explicitly asks for that.

## Editing

- Prefer patch-style edits for manual changes.
- Avoid unrelated formatting churn.
- Add comments only when they clarify non-obvious behavior.

## Task Planning

- For analysis, refactoring, migration, or multi-step implementation tasks,
  create or update a concise checklist in `tools/project-memory/pending-tasks.md`
  or a dedicated task plan in `tools/project-memory/` before editing code.
- Include the goal, planned changes, execution order, risks or dependencies, and
  verification steps.
- Update progress as meaningful steps complete.
- Keep plans concise. Do not store full diffs, large logs, generated outputs,
  secrets, credentials, or private production data.

## Shared Instruction Updates

- When this project reveals a reusable improvement to agent instructions,
  workflows, templates, or checklists, write a dated recommendation to the shared
  instruction library's `updates/` folder if it is available.
- If no shared instruction library is available, use a local intake folder such
  as `tools/instruction-updates/` or
  `tools/project-memory/instruction-updates/`.
- Treat recommendations as intake, not accepted rules.
- Do not add a shared instruction library as a project dependency, package,
  submodule, symlink, or runtime reference unless the user explicitly asks for
  that.

## Verification

- Reread edited files after changes.
- Run the fastest relevant check first.
- Record checks run and failures in the handoff summary.

## Processes

- Ask before closing editors, apps, servers, or other visible processes.
- Launch GUI tools quietly in the background when possible.
