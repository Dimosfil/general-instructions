# Agent Instructions For This Repository

This repository is a shared library of reusable AI-agent instructions for current
and future projects.

## Purpose

Keep durable, project-agnostic rules, playbooks, templates, and checklists here.
Project-specific details belong in each project's own `AGENTS.md`, runbook, or
memory folder.

Treat this library as a token-economy and RAG-startup layer for projects that
copy it. Its short command prefix is always `gi`, not `GAI` or another alias.
Use it to restore only task-relevant context through local instructions, handoff
summaries, targeted searches, accepted migrations, and project memory instead of
broad repository reads or large chat outputs.

Treat connected projects as experience sources for `gi`. When a project reveals
a reusable workflow, failure pattern, token-saving tactic, or agent instruction
improvement, capture a concise recommendation with evidence and privacy review
so this library can turn it into accepted guidance after maintenance review.

## Repository Map

- `README.md`: short human-facing overview.
- `INDEX.md`: catalog of reusable instruction documents.
- `GENERAL_DEVELOPMENT_PLAYBOOK.md`: baseline playbook for starting and
  maintaining projects with AI coding agents.
- `templates/`: copyable starter files for project repositories.
- `checklists/`: short operational checklists.

## Rule Precedence

- Treat safety, secrets, and destructive-action constraints as highest priority.
- Follow explicit user requests unless they conflict with safety or repository
  rules.
- Let project-local `AGENTS.md`, runbooks, and working agreements override these
  shared reusable rules when they are more specific.
- Use these shared rules when project-local guidance is absent or ambiguous.
- Prefer token economy and optimization after the correct scope is clear.

## Content And Authoring

- Keep instructions reusable across projects.
- Do not add secrets, credentials, private project data, or local machine paths
  unless the file is explicitly a local example.
- If a rule applies only to one specific project, do not put it here.
- Prefer small, focused documents over one giant policy file.
- When adding a new instruction file, also add it to `INDEX.md`.
- Write instruction documents in imperative voice, with one rule per bullet when
  practical.
- Avoid long nested conditionals, filler, narration, and non-actionable prose.
- Use clear Markdown headings and copy-pasteable examples.

## Tool Usage And Token Economy

- Do not print full `git diff` output by default. Prefer `git diff --stat` and
  targeted queries for relevant files or patterns.
- Do not read large files in full by default, including large `index.html`,
  bundled JS/CSS, logs, lockfiles, generated files, and build artifacts. Prefer
  targeted searches, heads, tails, or small line ranges, such as
  `Get-Content -TotalCount`, `Get-Content -Tail`, and `Select-String`.
- Command examples use PowerShell on Windows. Use equivalent head, tail,
  line-range, and targeted-search commands on other shells.
- Search for specific symbols, paths, errors, or patterns before doing broad
  repository scans.
- Do not print large logs. Prefer tails and targeted error searches.
- For verification, count or query HTML elements programmatically instead of
  printing the whole HTML document.
- Do not produce broad artifacts, such as zip archives, or run full check
  matrices unless the user explicitly asks for that scope.
- Broader scans, longer logs, or larger check suites are acceptable for incident
  debugging, explicit user requests, release checks, or unclear failures after
  targeted searches.
- Final responses should summarize only the changes, checks, and current status;
  do not restate the full investigation context.

## Scope And Startup Behavior

- Ask before expanding into unrelated scope. Proceed without asking only when
  the expansion is required for the stated goal and remains low-risk.
- Treat this repository root as the filesystem boundary for normal work. Do not
  read, search, edit, create, delete, move, or inspect files in another project
  or arbitrary external folder unless the user gives an explicit concrete path
  and action. Communicate with other projects through documented APIs,
  connectors, or task-manager endpoints.
- Follow `patterns/FIRST_MESSAGE_HANDLING.md` for first-message title handling
  and shared-instruction bootstrap requests.

## UI And Focus

- Launch applications in the background so focus does not jump away from the
  user's current window.
- For web applications, assume the user will inspect the UI manually. Do not
  open, browse, screenshot, or visually inspect the UI automatically unless the
  user explicitly asks for that.

## Update Intake

- When maintaining this `general-instructions` repository, treat `updates/` as a
  dated intake queue. Review update files newest-first, move accepted reusable
  rules into the main library, and remember accepted updates by committing them.
- External projects that consume these shared instructions must not read
  `updates/` during startup or bootstrap.
- When another project reveals a reusable improvement to shared instructions,
  write a dated recommendation to this repository's `updates/` folder if it is
  available.
- If this repository is unavailable, use a project-local intake folder such as
  `tools/instruction-updates/` or `tools/project-memory/instruction-updates/`
  with the same dated filename pattern.
- Project recommendations should explain the observed problem, reusable rule or
  workflow, evidence paths, affected files or commands, and any risks. Remove
  secrets, credentials, private user data, production data, and project-specific
  details that are not needed as examples.
- Treat recommendations as intake only. Do not add this repository as a
  dependency, package, submodule, symlink, or runtime reference unless the user
  explicitly asks for that.

## Verification

For documentation-only changes:

```powershell
git diff --check
```

For larger changes, reread the edited files and confirm links, paths, and
checklists still match the repository layout.

If adding a file under `templates/`, `patterns/`, or `checklists/`, update
`INDEX.md` in the same change.

## Git Policy

Default policy: the agent may edit and verify files; the user reviews and
commits unless they explicitly ask the agent to commit. Follow
`patterns/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` for commit requests, dirty worktrees, diff hygiene,
and project commit-message language preferences.
